# Detecting Credit Card Fraud 
Machine learning project for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. Includes EDA, class imbalance handling (SMOTE), model comparison (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM), hyperparameter tuning, evaluation with ROC/PR curves, and SHAP interpretability.
